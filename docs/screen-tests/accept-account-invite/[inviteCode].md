- Click the inviter’s name/avatar and confirm it opens their public profile; navigate back.
- Click “Copy invite link” and verify the full URL is in your clipboard.
- Paste the copied link in a new tab and confirm it opens the same invite state.
- Click “Accept invite” and confirm membership is created/updated and a success message appears.
- After acceptance, verify the app switches to the target account (account selector/header reflects the new account).
- From the success state, proceed directly to the dashboard without needing to sign in again.
- If you already belong to the account, confirm a message appears and “Switch to this account” changes context immediately.
- With an invite targeting a specific email, sign in with a different email; see a non-blocking warning, proceed, and accept successfully.
- Click “Decline” and confirm it uses low-emphasis styling and navigates away without joining the account.
- Open an expired or revoked invite and confirm a clear explanation; the Accept button is disabled/hidden with guidance to request a new invite.

- Simulate a transient load error and use “Retry” to successfully load the invite details.
