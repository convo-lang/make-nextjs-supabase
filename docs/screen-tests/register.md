- Visit /register as a guest and see a centered form with Name, Email, Organization name, Password, and a “Create account” button.
- Confirm each input has a visible label and is focusable in a logical tab order.
- Ensure the “Create account” button label is correct and is the only primary CTA.
- Toggle password visibility; text shows/hides and the toggle has an accessible label.
- Submit with all fields empty; inline required errors appear and invalid fields get aria-invalid="true".
- Enter an invalid email format and submit; see a specific email format error and aria-invalid on Email.
- Enter a short password (<8 chars); see guidance about minimum length.
- Add leading/trailing spaces to the email; on submit, whitespace is trimmed.
- When submitting, the primary button disables, shows a subtle loading state, and the form becomes read-only.
- Force a server error (e.g., reuse an existing email); see a descriptive error announced via an aria-live region.
- Complete a successful sign-up with immediate session; briefly see success then land on the dashboard.
- After successful sign-up, verify the new organization name appears in the app (e.g., dashboard/header).
- Complete a sign-up flow that requires email confirmation; see a “Check your email” notice with clear instructions.
- If already signed in, the form is replaced by a friendly “You’re already registered” notice with a link to proceed.
- If an invite code is present, verify a link to accept-account-invite/[inviteCode] is available instead of creating a new org.
- Click “I already have an account”; confirm it navigates to /sign-in.
- Press Enter from a focused input when the form is valid; the form submits.
- Tab through to ensure visible focus states on inputs, toggle, and buttons.
- Confirm error messages and status changes are announced to screen readers (aria-live works).
- Verify brand color is used only for the primary “Create account” button; secondary actions use low-emphasis styles.
