# Screen Description

Name: Task Detail
Route: /task/[taskId]

## Description
A focused workspace for a single task within the current account. Users can read and refine the task title and markdown description, switch between edit and preview modes, and perform key workflow actions. On wide screens, the page supports a side-by-side editor and preview; on smaller screens, users can toggle between Edit and Preview tabs. The page can enter a distraction-free full-screen/no-margins mode to maximize the editor area. Status is clearly shown (active, completed, archived), with lightweight metadata (created/updated, owner) and a subtle share section for copying the task’s permalink. Brand styling is reserved for the most important action (e.g., Mark complete) and thin highlights for share affordances.
